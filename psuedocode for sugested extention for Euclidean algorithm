Function ListDivisors(gcd): Defines the function with one parameter, 'gcd', which is the greatest common divisor of two integers for which the divisors are to be listed.

    divisors = []: Initializes an empty list to hold the divisors of 'gcd'.

    for i from 1 to gcd inclusive: Iterates through each number from 1 up to the value of 'gcd' to check if it is a divisor.

        if gcd mod i == 0: Checks if 'gcd' is divisible by 'i' without leaving a remainder.

            divisors.append(i): If 'i' is a divisor of 'gcd', it is added to the list of divisors.

    return divisors: Once the loop completes, the function returns the list of all divisors of 'gcd'.
